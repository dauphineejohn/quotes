## Longer quotes
+ "Those who have not found their true wealth, which is the radiant joy of Being and the deep, unshakable peace that comes with it, are beggars, even if they have great material wealth.

+ "I don't understand why we must do things in this world, why we must have friends and aspirations, hopes and dreams.

+ "If your happiness depends on someone or something happening, you're setting yourself up for suffering. Nothing is guaranteed, so let go of your *if onlys* and build your happiness in the here and now."
  ```
  If you think about what you need to be happy, you might think about achieving something in your career, or a relationship, or something you own. 
  All of these things have something in common - they are conditions for happiness. 
  As human beings we naturally get attached to goals and the status quo.

  The bad news is that not everything in our career goes as we would like, relationships can end, possessions break and are lost. 
  The good news is that you can enjoy what you have right now and be happy, even if the only thing that you possess is the ability to breathe in and out.

  By letting go of our attachment to things that we believe we need to be happy we can actually live calmer, happier lives. 
  Of course it is great to enjoy the things we own, the people we love and our work - 
  but accepting that life will change and that we don't need external conditions for happiness reduces the suffering we feel when things don't go as we hope.
  ```

+ "It seems to me that our attachment to purpose is born from our need to prove something to ourselves. But life is simply life, and is not trying to prove anything at all. This springtime will not try to be better than last springtime, and neither will an ash tree try to become an oak. By letting go our fascination with the extra-ordinary and spectacular, we can allow ourselves to recognize the simple wonder that lies within the ordinary. For life is its own purpose and doesn't need a reason to be. That is its beauty."

+ "How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away. One of history's few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can't live without it." *-Yuval Noah Harari*

+ "A cyclist is a disaster for the country's economy: he does not buy cars and does not borrow money to buy. He does not pay for insurance policies. He does not buy fuel, does not pay for the necessary maintenance and repairs. He does not use paid parking. He does not cause serious accidents. He does not require multi-lane highways. He does not get fat. Healthy people are neither needed nor useful for the economy. They don't buy medicine. They do not go to hospitals or doctors. Nothing is added too the country's GDP (gross domestic product). On the contrary, every new McDonald's restaurant creates at least 30 jobs: 10 cardiologists, 10 dentists, 10 dietary experts and nutritionists, and obviously, people who work at the restaurant itself." *-General Director or Euro Exim Bank Ltd.* 

+ "Just remember, if you ever feel like an *underachiever*":
  ```
  Under the status quo, an *achieved* person is someone who does the most for people with power. 
  You owe nothing to the world, and you owe nothing to other people, let alone people who want to use you for profit. 
  The only person you owe anything to is yourself.

  So if you don't know what to do with your life, and you don't have a *dream job*, that's okay. 
  There is no legitimate authority to tell you what to do with your life, 
  and *dream jobs* are a made up concept in order to get people excited about making money for other people.
  ```
  
+ "Happiness is more likely to come from the things that we remove from our lives versus the things that we add."
  - When we think about happiness, we often focus on things that we could add to our life (i.e., new relationships, new jobs, more money, new tech gadgets), but happiness is more likely to come from things that we can remove from our life.
  - Things to potentially cut from your life if they are causing issues:
    - Toxic relationships
    - Dwelling on the past
    - Social obligations
    - Trying to please others
    - Caffeine
    - Alcohol and/or drugs
    - Junk food
    - Blaming others
    - Social media
    
+ "How liberal society still adheres to colonialism and has not abandoned it's principles or learnt from it's genocides:"
  ```
  It is assumed every single person values the same things and has the exact same definition 
  of success and universal good when there were or are cultures out there who would see 
  their definitions of *success* as failure.
  
  In reality, these definitions of *universal good* is what was used as an excuse to commit 
  genocide against native peoples all around the world, as well as in taking away their 
  children to *save* them from themselves.
  
  Societies still effectively have not learnt to leave others alone and to let people live or die as they choose.
  
  The trouble is not *living standards* if that is what they personally value, it is using it 
  as an excuse to take away people's freedom of choice as police do when tearing down the structures 
  built by homeless people today by framing their lifestyles as *uncivilised* and *savage*.
  
  Every single dwelling must be connected to the system and be connected to a grid, 
  but if you don't obey, it gets torn down immediately because of *greater moral good*.
  
  People who are neurodivergent in a way that makes them incapable of operating in a capitalist 
  workforce environment suffer a lot in that they are never allowed to actually live and work 
  in ways more suited to their brain pattern.
  ```
  
+ "...Some complain such a life is full of poverty, deprivation. It is unrealistic and harsh."
  > Those with such a view - in the most charitable or explanations - see wealth as the absence of want, and therefore poverty as the existence of want. In this framing, if you place no value in material possessions, wealth, or power, you cannot truly ever be poor and experience the harsh stress and social embarassment that comes with iit. Begging, dumpster diving, or showering in public is not a deragatory or debasing act when you do not care about status or how other people see you.
  
  > That lesson still applies today; there would not be hunger if more were willing to eat simply , freeing up vast resources so that all may eat. There would not be slavery - wage slavery or otherwise, if people did not pursue power over others. And the planetary ecosystems would be much better off if there were less maniacal drive to accumulate material possessions as markers of status.
  
  > It is *offensive* that supercars, mansions, massive corporations owned by shareholders, an expensive international travel industry, and factory farming animal operations exist - when hundreds of millions of people consume less than $2 per day purchasing power parity.
  
  > If Diogenes were alive today, he would criticize the typical western lifestyle, especially those of the rich, and anyone in a developed country who wasn't donating a substantial portion of their income to those with the least resources. At the bare minimum, the Giving What We Can pledge to donate 10% of income to effective charities.
  
  > And, he would teach that there is diginity in poverty. That the person that is comfortable and at peace living on the street in NYC or San Francisco is in many ways better adjusted and better for the world than the wealthy, rapacious capitalists in the towers surrounding them.
  
  > Vows of poverty are not calls to return to a primal state - though that is how the wealthy and powerful view such ideas. They are instead indictments of the moral character of society that forces poverty on others, both in the sense of taking most of the value of their labor, and in pushing the social mindset that accumulating wealth, power, and fame makes you a better person.
